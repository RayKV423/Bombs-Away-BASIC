# Bombs-Away-BASIC
Bombs Away is a 1970s text-based WWII game where you fly a WWII bomber for one of the countries of your choice. David Sherman originally wrote it in BASIC programming language somewhere in the 1970s while David Ahl modified it for his book "[BASIC Computer Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games)".

This source code is included in Ahl's book of programs written in BASIC programming language "BASIC Computer Games" which you can find online [here](https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=24).
